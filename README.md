# ContactsInfo_MondayWorkshopApp1
Repository for the Week 13B Monday Workshop

# Description
1. Make/prepare the form!
2. Make a structure named “Person”, with the help of it we can store name, address, age and telephone number of individuals. Define a specification called “Type”, which contains the “Home”, “Workplace” and “Mobile” values. Expand the structure definition with a “Type” datamember. Define a constructor operation to the structure, and overwrite the inheritable ToString() action.
3. Define a class called telephone directory, and the objects of it represent a list which contains 50 people’s data at longest. Define a constructor procedure to the class. Define an operation of which we can expand the list with new data of people.
4. Make the “Type”  combobox contain the elements of “Type” specification! Prepare the operation of clicking the “Admit” button, which expand the telephone directory with the specific personal data ( give a written reference about the exceptions arising at the conversion of age)!
5. Implement the System.Collections.IEnumerable interface with the “Telephone directory” class. Prepare the operation of clicking the “Listing” button, which visualizes the content of the telephone directory in a chat window.
